# Pokemon Website

This is a CPSC 455 project.
Project Progress after Workshop 1

First step:
Brainstorm some ideas for the first lab. In Lab 1, we will finalize groups, and discuss project ideas. By Lab 2, you should have selected a project topic. 


Project Requirements:
Must be completed with your group before workshop 2


*  Let TAs know who your group members are (we will do some icebreaker exercises today)
*  Must have a repo in github which all group members can access and send us the link on slack. (See instructions “How to hand in” below.)
   * In order to create a repo, you will need to decide on a project name
  project name: Pokemon Website
*  Project Description: Write 3-5 sentences on your project topic. (try to address all points below)
   * Who is it for? <br>
      **Pokemon lovers**<br>
   * What will it do? (What "human activity" will it support?)<br>
     **1. Search for different pokemons**<br> 
     **2. User can collect pokemons**<br>
     **3. User can Filter pokemons by their types**<br>
   * What type of data will it store?<br>
     **1. Pokemon:Image, number, char**<br> 
     **2. User/Admin Account: number, char**<br>
   * What will users be able to do with this data?<br>
      **1. Users: Search for pokemons**<br> 
      **2. Users: Filter pokemons based on their types**<br>
      **3. Users: Add the pokemons they collect to their user account**<br>
   * What is some additional functionality you can add/remove based on time constraints?<br>
     **1. Admin can add or delete pokemons**<br> 
     **2. Users can add comments to pokemons**<br>
     **3. Website can recognize pokemon pictures by ML.**<br> 

*  Project task requirements:<br>
   * 3-5 minimal requirements (will definitely complete)
      **1. Users can Search for different pokemons**<br>
      **2. Users can collect pokemons**<br> 
      **3. Users can Filter pokemon according to their types**<br>
      **4. Users can sign up or login to their accounts**<br>   
   
   * 3-7 "standard" requirements (will most likely complete)

      **1. Admin can login an Admin account**<br> 
      **2. Add pokemons to database by Admin** <br>
      **3. Delete pokemons from database by Admin** <br>

   * 2-3 stretch requirements (plan to complete at least 1)
      **1. The website can recognize pokemon pictures by ML.** <br>
      **2. Users can make comments for different pokemons.** <br> 
      **3. Support different languages for users (e.g English and Chinese)**<br> 

*  Pick 2 of your minimal requirements and break each of them down into ~2-5 smaller tasks!
   *  This will help you divide up work among your teammates<br>
     **A. Users can search pokemon**<br>
       **1. Create Database for Pokemon**<br>
       **2. Search function based on the Pokemon name**<br>
       **3. Search page which displays pokemon info and user can collect pokemon from here** <br>

     **B. Users can Collect Pokemons**<br>
        **1. Create Database for User, every user has a list of collected pokemons. Have different function Apis to manipulate this list (Add/Remove/Update)**<br>
        **2.   Login page for user to do authentication**<br>
        **3.   After a user clicks on the collect button on Search page, that pokemon will be added   to that user's collection list**<br>
        **4.   Collection page shows collected pokemons by a user.**<br> 
*  Finally, draw 2-3 rough sketch prototypes of some key tasks of your app. Sketch these physically on paper and then scan and add to your repo.<br>
        **Other doc**
