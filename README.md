# Pokedex

This is a CPSC 455 project.
Project Progress after Workshop 1

**High Level Description:**

Pokedex is a one-stop web application for Pokemon lovers and trainers. Users can find the natures and characteristics of Pokemon that they want on the application. The application also allows users to comment on Pokemon for social and networking purposes.

First step:
Brainstorm some ideas for the first lab. In Lab 1, we will finalize groups, and discuss project ideas. By Lab 2, you should have selected a project topic. 


Project Requirements:
Must be completed with your group before workshop 2


*  Let TAs know who your group members are (we will do some icebreaker exercises today)
*  Must have a repo in github which all group members can access and send us the link on slack. (See instructions “How to hand in” below.)
   * In order to create a repo, you will need to decide on a project name<br>
     **project name: Pokedex**<br>
     **Team name: Team Rocket**<br>

*  Project Description: Write 3-5 sentences on your project topic. (try to address all points below)
   * Who is it for? <br>
      **Pokemon lovers**<br>
   * What will it do? (What "human activity" will it support?)<br>
     **1. Search for different pokemons**<br> 
     **2. User can Filter pokemons by their types**<br>
   * What type of data will it store?<br>
     **1. Pokemon:Image, number, char**<br> 
     **2. User/Admin Account: number, char**<br>
   * What will users be able to do with this data?<br>
      **1. Users: Search for pokemons**<br> 
      **2. Users: Filter pokemons based on their types**<br>
      **3. Users: Add the pokemons they collect to their user account**<br>
   * What is some additional functionality you can add/remove based on time constraints?<br>
     **1. Admin can add or delete pokemons**<br> 
     **2. Users can add comments to pokemons**<br>
     **3. Website can recognize pokemon pictures by ML.**<br> 

*  Project task requirements:<br>
   * 3-5 minimal requirements (will definitely complete)<br> 
      **1. Users can Search for different pokemons**<br>
      **2. Users can Filter pokemon according to their types**<br>
      **3. Users can sign up or login to their accounts**<br>   
   
   * 3-7 "standard" requirements (will most likely complete)<br> 

      **1. Admin can login an Admin account**<br> 
      **2. Add pokemons to database by Admin** <br>
      **3. Delete pokemons from database by Admin** <br>
      **4. Users can update their profile**<br>

   * 2-3 stretch requirements (plan to complete at least 1)<br> 
      **1. Privide Engish and Chinese language versions.** <br>
      **2. Users can make post and comments in forum.** <br> 
      **3. Users can login via their google accounts or github accounts.**<br> 

*  Pick 2 of your minimal requirements and break each of them down into ~2-5 smaller tasks!<br> 
   *  This will help you divide up work among your teammates<br>
     **A. Users can search pokemon**<br>
       **1. Create Database for Pokemon**<br>
       **2. Search function based on the Pokemon name**<br>
       **3. Search page which displays pokemon info and user can collect pokemon from here** <br>

     **B. Users can Collect Pokemons**<br>
        **1. Create Database for User, every user has a list of collected pokemons. Have different function Apis to manipulate this list (Add/Remove/Update)**<br>
        **2.   LoginPage page for user to do authentication**<br>
        **3.   After a user clicks on the collect button on Search page, that pokemon will be added   to that user's collection list**<br>
        **4.   Collection page shows collected pokemons by a user**<br> 
*  Finally, draw 2-3 rough sketch prototypes of some key tasks of your app. Sketch these physically on paper and then scan and add to your repo.<br>
