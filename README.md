### Unit 4 - Node & Express

Node.js and TypeScript are used to complete the back end. 

## Steps in the future

> Because of time constraint, we couldn't let the website recognize pokemon pictures by Machine Learning. However, in the future, our team will try to realize the funtion.

- Third-Party Login
